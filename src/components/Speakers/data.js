  //   bio: `Dennis R. Schaart has worked in academia as well as in the medical device industry, always at the intersection of physics, technology, and medicine. He started as an R&amp;D physicist at Nucletron (now Elekta), where he developed new devices for radiotherapy. He obtained his doctoral degree (with highest honors) in 2002. He then joined TU Delft to set up a new research line on in-vivo molecular imaging technology, with special focus on ultrafast detectors for time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF- PET). At present, his main research interests include novel technology for in vivo molecular imaging and for image guidance in (proton) radiotherapy. Since 2016, he coordinates the research activities of TU Delft within the R&amp;D program of the Holland Proton Therapy Centre (HollandPTC), a joint initiative of Erasmus MC, LUMC, and TU Delft. He also serves as a member of the HollandPTC R&amp;D Program Board. In 2017 he established the new section Medical Physics &amp; Technology at TU Delft. Dennis has (co-)authored more than 100 papers that have been cited more than 5000 times and is a frequently invited speaker.`,
  //   title: `Towards the Next Generation of Proton Therapy`,
  //   abstract: `About half of all cancer patients in the Netherlands receive some form of radiotherapy. Ideally, a sufficient radiation dose is given to the tumor to kill all cancer cells, without inducing unwanted side effects. In reality, compromises always have to be made. The majority of patients are irradiated with high-energy X-ray photons. For radiotherapy purposes, the physical properties of protons are much more attractive. However, the characteristic dose profile, with a sharp dose falloff behind the so- called Bragg peak, also makes proton therapy sensitive to deviations from the pre-calculated treatment plan. Examples are patient setup errors, inter-fraction anatomical changes, intra-fraction organ motion, and range uncertainty. These phenomena may, if not adequately dealt with, result in severe overdosing to healthy tissues and/or underdosing in the tumor. In photon radiotherapy, image guidance has developed to a point where highly optimized dose distributions are applied routinely and safely in the clinic. To fully exploit the physical advantages of protons, similar approaches need to be developed in proton therapy. Novel technology, mathematics, computer science, and medical physics all play an important role in this multidisciplinary challenge. The Holland Proton Therapy Centre (HollandPTC), a joint initiative by Erasmus MC, LUMC and TU Delft, has the ambition to realize the full potential of proton therapy, so as to improve clinical outcomes while reducing the side effects of therapy. This talk presents some of HollandPTCâ€™s research activities and how they will contribute to the development of the next generation of proton therapy.`,
